# ToDoAPI

## Inital Setup
Please make sure you have Visual Studio installed, as this was all set up via Visual Studio.
Grab the ZIP folder from this repo. Once you have extracted the contents go to the sln file and double click on that, it should open in Visual Studio. 
You should see 2 projects in the solution, one called ToDoAPI and the other ToDoData.

The ToDOAPI project is the .NET Web API Project 
The ToDoData project is a library project that houses all the necessary folders and .cs files, that talk to the db and control the inner workings of the API.

## DB Setup
Once you have the solution open go to tools -> Nuget Package Manager -> Package Manager Console.
